# Productivity_Visualization

⭐️ **This is my final project for CSC 201 - Introduction to Computer Science.**


⭐️ **Technology**

☑️ I used Python and Graphics library to make this program.


⭐️ **Why did I decide to make this program?**

☑️ Working for a long period of time does not mean working productively. Indeed, there are days when I just sit at a desk for hours and think that I am being productive. However, instead of getting the work done, I spend half of the time doing something else like watching Youtube videos or shopping online. Therefore, I decided to make this program in order to keep track of my REAL productivity. At the end of a day or a week, I could run this program to see how truly productive I was.


⭐️ **How does this program work?**

☑️ In this program, only one account is allowed. When the users run the program for the first time, they will have to register for an account. The user will be asked to enter the username, the number of courses they are taking and the names of those courses. After the first time, the users will just need to click Login to continue using the program.

☑️ There are 2 main features. The users could choose to see the visualization of their daily productivity or weekly productivity.

☑️ If the users choose to see the visualization of their daily productivity, they will be asked to enter the day and the week on which they want to see the visualization of their productivity. Then, the program will check whether the data for that given day is available. If not, the users will be asked to enter the data which is the percentage of completed tasks for each course on that given day. Else, the program will show a Bar Chart visualizing their productivity on that day.

☑️ If the users choose to see the visualization of their weekly productivity, they will be asked to enter the week on which they want to see the visualization of their productivity. Then, the program will check whether the data for that given day is available. If there is no data available for any days of that week, the users will have to input the data. If there is data available for some days of that week, the users will be allowed to choose to input the data for the missing days or to see the visualization of the days on which the data is available.

☑️ After showing the visualization, the users will be asked whether to continue or to quit. If they choose to continue, a menu window will appear again for them to choose whether to see the visualization of their daily productivity or weekly productivity. Else, the program will be closed.
